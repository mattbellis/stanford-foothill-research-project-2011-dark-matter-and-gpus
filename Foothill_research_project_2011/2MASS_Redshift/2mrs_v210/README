A. 2MASS Redshift Survey input catalog:

  The initial selection of sources for this redshift survey was based on the
2MASS Extended Source Catalog (XSC), provided by Tom Jarrett. The 2MASS
photometric pipeline performed a variety of magnitude measurements for each
band. We selected the isophotal magnitudes, measured at the K=20 mag/sq arcsec
isophote, as our primary set of magnitudes. We also include the "total
magnitudes" derived by the pipeline, but do not use them for our sample
selection. The columns extracted from the 2MASS XSC photometry table are
listed below.

  In the case of galaxies with angular sizes much greater than the width of a
single 2MASS scan, we used the photometry presented in the 2MASS Large Galaxy
Atlas (LGA) by Jarrett et al. (2003AJ....125..525J). Please refer to the
following links for details of the 2MASS XSC and LGA photometry:

http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/2MASS/PubGalPS/XSC_key.html
http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/2MASS/LGA/

  We applied an extinction correction using the maps of Schlegel, Finkbeiner &
Davis (1998ApJ...500..525S). Our tables report the extinction-corrected 2MASS
magnitudes, and we also provide the value of E(B-V) from SFD98 which we used for
the corrections.

  We selected 46,051 sources which met the following criteria:

  (i)   detected in both Ks and H bands
  (ii)  Ks     <=11.75 mag
  (iii) E(B-V) <  1.0  mag
  (iv)  |b|    >  5.0  deg for 30 < l < 330 ; |b| > 8.0 deg otherwise

  We rejected 634 sources deemed to be of galactic origin (multiple stars,
planetary nebulae, HII regions), pieces of galaxies detected as separate sources
by the 2MASS pipeline, star+galaxy blends, and galaxies with compromised
photometry. These objects are listed in the file "2mrs_1175_rej.dat", located in
the "add_rej" subdirectory.

  Tom Jarrett kindly provided improved centroids and deblended magnitudes for
147 galaxies whose original XSC entries had been deleted in the preceding
step. These objects were added to the catalog and are listed in the file
"2mrs_1175_add.dat", located in the "add_rej" subdirectory.

  Our final input catalog (after the additions and deletions listed above)
contained 44,564 entries. In this work, we present redshifts for 43,477 of
these, or 97.6% of the sample.


B. 2MASS Redshift Survey catalog contents:

  The main redshift catalog is in the "catalog/" subdirectory. Additional
redshifts for fainter galaxies can be found in the "extras/" subdirectory.

  This distribution contains both space-deliminted ASCII and FITS binary table
versions of the catalog, with extensions ".dat" and ".fits" respectively.

  2MASS galaxies that meet the selection criteria listed above and have a
measured redshifts are listed in the files called "2mrs_1175_done.[dat,fits]"
(43,477 entries)

  2MASS galaxies that meet the selection criteria listed above but do not have
a measured redshift are listed in the files called "2mrs_1175_nocz.[dat,fits]"
(1,087 entries). If you have observed one of these galaxies please let us know!

  Below is a description of the columns in the catalog. Columns 1-3, 6-17, and
19-22 contain information obtained from the 2MASS XSC photometry tables. The
original names of these columns in the XSC database are given in brackets. The
remaining columns contain information added by us as part of this work.

            k_flg_k20fe, h_flg_k20fe, j_flg_k20fe]. A "Z" in the first column
	    indicates that we have used magnitudes from the 2MASS LGA.

29. CAT_ID: name of galaxy in input redshift catalog


C. Sources of redshifts

  All 2MASS XSC entries meeting the selection criteria listed in (A) were used
as an input list to query the NASA Extragalactic Database (NED) for published
redshift measurements. Any redshifts described below as originating from NED are
based on a set of queries carried out between 2011 Feb 14 and 2011 Jun 21.
These queries resulted in a total of 31,927 redshifts used in this work.

  Additionally, we searched John Huchra's ZCAT catalog for redshift information
on all galaxies in the sample. If a galaxy had a match in both NED and ZCAT,
the redshifts were compared. We gave preference to NED redshifts, except for a
few cases explained below.

  Similar queries were conducted throughout the duration of this survey,
starting in early 1998. Galaxies without a match in either database were
targeted for observation at the Fred L. Whipple Observatory 1.5-m telescope,
the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory 1.5-m telescope, and the McDonald
2.1-m telescope. Observations were conducted between 1998 July and 2011
January.

  The provenance of redshifts presented in this catalog is detailed below. The
one-letter codes listed below are used in column 27 of the catalog (see above).
The values in brackets indicate the number of redshifts associated with each 
source.

- N [31,353]: Previously-published redshifts listed in NED, found by performing
    	      a "Query by Name" using the 2MASS XSC IDs. In the case of galaxies
    	      with more than one redshift measurement, the "default" value
    	      listed by NED was used.

- F  [7,551]: New redshifts measured as part of the 2MRS project at the FLWO
              1.5-m telescope.

- C  [3,211]: New redshifts measured as part of the 2MRS project at the CTIO
              1.5-m telescope.

- O    [671]: 2MASS XSC sources for which a ZCAT redshift was assigned.
    	      This includes 585 entries with no redshifts in NED, but with a
	      redshift in ZCAT, as well as 86 entries for which the ZCAT
	      redshift was chosen over the NED redshift.

- M    [574]: Previously-published redshifts listed in NED. Unlike code "N"
    	      above, these redshifts are not the default value found in NED
    	      when querying the database by name using the 2MASS XSC ID.

	      In 520 of these cases, the redshifts were found by performing a
    	      "Query by Position" with a tolerance radius of 1.3 arcminutes.
    	      Most of these objects are already "associated" (in NED terms) with
    	      the 2MASS object but have not yet been merged into a single entry.

	      In the other 54 cases, we have chosen to adopt an alternative
    	      redshift measurement, already listed in NED and linked to the
    	      2MASS ID. This alternative measurement is in better agreement
	      with other published values also listed in NED, or it has a
    	      significantly smaller uncertainty than the default NED value.

- D    [117]: New measurements obtained as part of the 2MRS project at 
              McDonald Observatory (2.1-m telescope or HET)


D. Details of adopted redshifts that are not the NED default value

  The files included in the subdirectory "ned_diff" contain lists of the 2MASS
XSC entries for which we did not use the default redshift provided by NED at
the time of our queries (between 2011 Feb 14 and 2011 Jun 21). The contents of
these files are as follows:

2mrs_1175_neddiff_cfd.dat - New 2MRS observations of galaxies which have a 
                            previously published redshift listed in NED
                            (codes "C"/"D"/"F" above). [N=3,332]

2mrs_1175_neddiff_del.dat - NED entries discarded for being erroneous; 
                            no other redshift in the literature. [N=3]

2mrs_1175_neddiff_m1.dat  - The NED query by name, using the 2MASS XSC ID, did
                            not return a match, but a query by position
                            (tolerance=1.3') returned a match. [N=520]

2mrs_1175_neddiff_m2.dat  - NED entries with multiple redshift measurements.
                            Default NED redshift in poor agreement with other
                            published measurements, or has a much larger
			    uncertainty.  Alternative NED redshift used. [N=54]

2mrs_1175_neddiff_o1.dat  - NED entries without redshift information, but ZCAT
                            contained a redshift (either from literature or from
                            Huchra's earlier unpublished observations) [N=585]

2mrs_1175_neddiff_o2.dat  - NED entries with redshift measurements, superceded
                            by ZCAT entries (either published measurements or
                            Huchra's earlier unpublished observations) [N=86]


E. 2MRS "bibcodes"

  As stated in the terms of use at the top of this file, any redshift with a
bibliographic code starting with "20112MRS" should be cited as "Huchra, et al.,
The 2MASS Redshift Survey, in preparation". There are several variants of this
code in the data files, primarily meant for internal use by 2MRS project
members. Here we provide additional information on these codes for those 
readers who might be interested.

20112MRS.FLWO.0000H: Observed at the Fred L. Whipple Observatory 1.5-m
                     telescope with the FAST spectrograph. Spectrum
                     reduced by the standard SAO TDC FAST pipeline.

20112MRS.CTIO.0000H: Observed at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory
                     1.5-m telescope with the R-C spectrograph. Spectrum
                     reduced by Lucas Macri using standard IRAF routines.

20112MRS.McDo.0000H: Observed at the McDonald Observatory 2.1-m telescope with
                     the Cassegrain Spectrometer. Spectrum reduced by Jeff
                     Mader & Teddy George using standard IRAF routines.

20112MRS.JPH..0000H: Observed as part of one of John Huchra's projects prior to
                     the start of the 2MRS, but never published.  Most (but not
                     all) were likely observed at the Fred L. Whipple
                     Observatory 1.5-m telescope with the FAST spectrograph.

20112MRS.MMT..0000H: Observed as part of one of John Huchra's projects prior to
                     the start of the 2MRS, but never published. Observed at
                     the Multiple Mirror Telescope with the Blue Channel or Red
                     Channel spectrographs. Spectrum reduced by the standard
                     SAO TDC FAST pipeline. SAO TDC archive number provided
                     when available (in files within "ned_diff" directory).

20112MRS.ZMA..0000H: Observed as part of one of John Huchra's projects prior to
                     the start of the 2MRS, but never published. Observed at
                     the Fred L. Whipple Observatory 1.5-m telescope with the
                     Z-machine spectrograph. Spectrum reduced by the standard
                     SAO TDC FAST pipeline. SAO TDC archive number provided
                     when available (in files within "ned_diff" directory).

20112MRS.####.0000H: Redshift provided to John Huchra by collaborators or
                     through a private communication. Please refer to
                     "ned_diff_o[12].dat" files for more information, and check
                     with Lucas Macri before publishing these redshifts before
                     the 2MASS Redshift Survey is in press.


F. Galaxy types

  Galaxy types are provided for a virtually complete sub-sample of 20,874
objects with K<=11.254 mag and |b|>10 deg. Any galaxies in this sub-sample that
did not have an existing classification were visually inspected and typed by
John Huchra. This complete sub-sample is identified with "JH" in the "type
source" column. Galaxy types for an additional 5,077 fainter objects were
already stored in ZCAT and have been propagated into the 2MRS catalog. These are
identified with "ZC" in the "type source" column. Galaxy types are encoded in
column 23 following the ZCAT convention. The first two characters are numeric
and correspond to the following:

 -9    QSO/AGN
 -7    Unclassified Elliptical
 -6    Compact Elliptical
 -5    E, and  dwarf E
 -4    E/SO
 -3    L-, SO-
 -2    L, SO
 -1    L+, SO+
  0    SO/a, SO-a
  1    Sa
  2    Sab
  3    Sb
  4    Sbc
  5    Sc
  6    Scd
  7    Sd
  8    Sdm
  9    Sm, Magellanic Spiral 
 10    Im, Irr I, Magellanic Irregular, Dwarf Irregular
 11    Compact Irregular, Extragalactic HII Region
 15    Peculiar, Unclassifiable
 16    Irr II
 19    Unclassified galaxy (visually confirmed to be a galaxy, but not typed)
 20    S..., Sc-Irr, Unclassified Spiral
 98    Galaxy that has never been visually examined.

  The next three characters are alphabetical and correspond to the following:

   Bar type:
       A    Unbarred
       X    Mixed~type
       B    Barred
   Peculiarities:
       D    Double or Multiple
       P    Peculiar
       R    Outer Ring
       r    Inner Ring
       s    S-shaped
       t    Mixed (Inner ring/S-shaped)
       T    Pseudo outer ring
       /    Spindle

  Objects removed from the original XSC catalog (2mrs_1175_rej.dat) are typed
as follows:

 21    Galaxy with bright star near nucleus -- photometry and/or redshift
       are unreliable
 22    Galaxy with compromised 2MASS XSC magnitudes -- flagged for reanalysis
 24    Open Star Cluster
 25    Plate Flaw, Star, etc. misclassified as galaxy! 
 26    T Tauri star (from IRAS Surveys) 
 27    Globular Cluster 
 30    Planetary Nebula 
 31    Dark Cloud (no object visible on POSS) 
 32    HII region in external galaxy 
 33    Reflection Nebulosity 
 35    HI cloud / High Velocity Clouds (HVC) 
 40    Piece of galaxy


G. Additional redshifts for 2MASS galaxies outside the survey limits

  Additional redshifts for 129,070 2MASS galaxies outside the survey limits are
presented in the "extra" subdirectory. This catalog is provided in both ASCII
and FITS binary table format in the files called "2mrs_extra_done.[dat,fits]".
The format of this catalog is very similar to the main catalog, but contains an
additional 3 columns with the following information:

30. RAdlt : delta-RA (in arcseconds) between the 2MASS galaxy position and the
            reported position of its matched counterpart in a redshift catalog
31. DCdlt : delta-Dec (in arcseconds), same as column #30
32. tl    : matching tolerance for the catalog containing this redshift

  The "extra" catalog contains 2,879 additional redshifts measured as part of
2MRS (codes "C", "D" or "F" in column 27). An additional 74 objects have
redshifts from NED and have code "N" or "M" in that column (see part [C] above
for details).  Sources with code "M" have additional information listed in the
"ned_diff" subdirectory.

  PLEASE NOTE: Most of the entries in this "extra" catalog have a "Z" in column
27, indicating that the redshift information was obtained by matching the 2MASS
XSC against ZCAT. These redshifts were not verified against NED.  Some redshifts
from older publications listed in ZCAT are known to have typos in their
coordinates and/or redshifts, resulting in bogus matches. Users are encouraged
to double-check the validity of these redshifts against NED and report any
discrepancies to lmacri@tamu.edu

  Additionally, very few of these galaxies were visually inspected to ensure their
photometry was not compromised by stars, image defects or pipeline errors (see
discussion on rejected sources in [A] above). This could be particularly
important for objects at low galactic latitude. A few sources that were rejected
"2mrs_extra_rej.dat" and a small number that were reprocessed by Tom Jarret can 
be found in "2mrs_extra_add.dat".

  Users should also consider obtaining SDSS, 6dF and 2dF redshifts directly from
the latest data releases of those projects, as ZCAT may not contain the most
up-to-date version of those catalogs.
